	"summary": "Bypassing policies imposed by the ImagePolicyWebhook and bypassing mountable secrets policy imposed by the ServiceAccount admission plugin",
	"component": "k8s.io/apiserver",
	"description": "Users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using ephemeral containers. The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service accountâ€™s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the `kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets` annotation are used together with ephemeral containers.\n\n",
